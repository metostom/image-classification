Basic Image Segmentation and Classification Using Superpixel Segmentation and K-means classification. Just a fun side project to try out some image classification techniques in and afternoon. 

# Summary

I downloaded a Eastern Washington RGB GeoTiff and used several superpixel algorithms to segment the landscape. Then basics statistics (mean, min, max, variance, skew...) were computed for each of the red, green, and blue bands within the segements. K-means classification was then used to define groupings within the segments and colored accordingly.
